Portfolio Website Design.

# I have used CSS, HTML, JavaScript to design this website. 
# I'm constantly adding updates to this website to make it modern and better. 
As I learn more about CSS and JavaScript I will be adding incremental updates slowly to make this a big project. Where I can showcase all the technical skills and properties learned in the couse of building this website.

If someone is watching this might not be the best looking infact its far from complete will keep updating this regularly.
