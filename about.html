        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I started my career with Amazon as a Retail associated and moved accross many departments and positions. Where I got to learn
            about retail domain, customer obsession, baias for action and picked up many skills.
            Later on I moved to a different team where we had to virtually support Amazon employees. As part of the team we went to offsite vists
            across India and partnered with different teams.
